### An open source, low cost and digitally fabricated geodesic construction system

This research explores the possibility of self-build collective and temporary spaces in the public space. This type of system can expand the type of activities citizens perform in the public space and, for example, test the success of public facilities in an experimental way before using more permanents building systems.

The geodesic dome was developed by Buckminster Fuller in the first half of the 20th century and was highly popular in the United Stated during the sixties and seventies. The design offers a great resistance to wind and can cover big spaces by using small size and light elements, this feature makes geodesic domes suitable for using unconventional materials and personal digital fabrication technologies.

In the summer of 2013 [Colaborativa.eu](http://colaborativa.eu) developed a first dome prototype using bamboo and 3d printed connectors. In august 2014 [Fab Lab Limerick](http://fablab.saul.ie) partnered with [Colaborativa.eu](http://colaborativa.eu) to develop a second iteration of the design, following the same principles of low-cost, digitally fabricated but using cardboard tubes and CNC cut connectors instead.

Global Green and [We create](http://wecreate.ie) provided the opportunity to test the prototype in a real case scenario when they invited us to assemble the dome at [Electric Picnic](http://www.electricpicnic.ie) 2014.

The geodesic dome is based on the 3V 5/9 Kruschke geometry. The frame is formed by 165 waterproofed cardboard tube struts of 4 different lengths and 61 digitally fabricated birch plywood connectors. The dome has a spherical diameter of 10 meters and it is 6 meters high. It has a floor area of 77 sqm and a perimeter of 32 meters.

This four week research project was carried out by Javier Burón, Stephen Bourke, Jack Byrne, Aoife Marnane and Jennifer O’Riordan. Dome prototype was assembled at the Electric Picnic by Michael McLaughlin, Aidan Byrne, Stephen Bourke, Jack Byrne, Aoife Marnane, Jennifer O’Riordan & Javier Burón. The research was a collaboration between Fab Lab Limerick and Colaborativa.eu. We are grateful to Global Green and WeCreate for inviting us to their area at the Electric Picnic.
